### Getting started Task project

- navigate to .env file and configure your database accordingly
- run migrations i.e. php artisan migrate (to migrate our tables)
- you can import database (i.e. task.sql available at the root folder) in our database or you can skip this step
- you can begin by registering account and if you imported from our database you can simply login with password: password@123
- ### _upon a successful login or registration you should be logged in_
 - #### Steps to follow
 - 1. dashboard shows all the tasks registered and can be sorted by dragging and dropping to the 
    position of your choice. In case you imported from our database you should be able to see all 
      the tasks listing here with additional options of either updating or deleting button.
 - 2. In case you don't see tasks listings it means you'll have to create project first then you'll 
    be redirected back to projects listing page you can then click the button on the right upper corner to
      add tasks i.e. you get to choose  project first then assign tasks to it by creating it. On the same page
      as project listing you can click view details button to view into depth the project and the
      associated tasks. you can also update or delete on the same page.
 - 3. if you've created tasks you will be redirected to the home page for tasks listings.
